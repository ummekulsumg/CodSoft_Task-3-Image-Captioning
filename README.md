# Task 3 — Image Captioning 🖼️

## 📌 Overview
This project generates **automatic captions for images** by combining **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  

Users can upload an image via a simple Tkinter GUI, and the system will generate a descriptive caption using a **pre-trained BLIP model**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload any image from your computer
- Instantly generate a descriptive caption
- Clean, user-friendly Tkinter interface
- Built using HuggingFace Transformers

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Tkinter, PIL, Torch)
- HuggingFace Transformers (BLIP model)
- Pre-trained image captioning models
